Was in service for a good decade or so. Mostly dealt with moving weapon cargo back and forth from Mars and Earth. After your initial standard military training, you go to on board simulation, and then eventually, the real deal. I dealt with minor ship repairs, so I didn't fly anything. But I remember how surreal take off felt, how weird it was looking out. Back then, they didn't have gravity simulations in every area- it was too expensive. Only the sleeping quarters and common dining spaces had it. You'd go back and forth and even work while floating around.\r\n\tO: <<if $age16 is 1>>So young for a space cadet!<<endif>><<if $age30 is 1>>Enlisted late?<<endif>><<if $age20 is 1>>I haven't seen a ship without gravity in ages.<<endif>>\r\n\tYeah. I de-enlisted a few years after, settled on Mars. Thought I'd have enough savings to look for work that was... less dangerous. And well, that's when all the chaos happened.\r\n\tO: Yeah, right.\r\n->relocating from Earth\r\n \tI was relocating from Earth. Do you remember when they were offering that \"life incentive\" government package to live on the new Mars colonies? \r\n\tO: Yes! So many of the people I knew went for that.<<if $age16 is 1>>You were accepted so young!<<endif>><<if $age20 is 1>>You were in that age bracket they wanted.<<endif>><<if $age30 is 1>>They didn't accept many people over 25...<<endif>>\r\n\tYeah. I was one of the lucky ones. I honestly don't know how I managed it... I assumed they wanted families, and me being single and relative-less at the time, I thought I'd be straight up rejected. But I guess they needed free agents in the community. So I accepted, and got on board those massive transportation ships. Thousands of people. The scale was so daunting. And because they were so big, they were slow. It took years to reach Mars. \r\n\tO: I can only assumed what happened there. I've heard stories.\r\n\tYou've probably heard correct. I was one of the unlucky ones that had the community areas restricted from them in the riots. We were forced to pay up, or starve to death. \r\n\tO: I guess that's how you found yourself out here, then.\r\n\tYeah. I didn't really have a choice.\r\n->fleeing my home\r\n \tI was running from Mars. I really did believe it was going to be the new future they promised on Earth.\r\n\tO: So you were one of those government chosen Mars residents?\r\n\tYeah. I was on board those massive transportation ships. Thousands of people. The scale was so daunting. And because they were so big, they were slow. It took years to reach Mars. And it only took me a year to leave from there. \r\n\tO: The riots?\r\n\tYou got it.\r\n\r\n[[...|Pause 4]]",
